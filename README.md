This repository contains codes I wrote while an undergrad at Utah State University.
I applied HDBSCAN clustering to all downhole geophysical data from SAFOD to identify structural/lithologic units in an unsupervised way.
I compared the clustering results for the full geophysical dataset, a wavelet denoised dataset, and a dimensionally reduced dataset. 
The key cluster boundaries correspond to the plate boundary, the Southwest deforming zone, and the Central deforming zone.
I also find two new boundaries: one between the plate boundary and the SDZ at ~3170m and one between the SDZ and CDZ at ~3220m.
